# AsimpleSIMPLE

This code implements a basic version of the 2D SIMPLE algorithm for solving simple incompressible fuid flow problems. 

## Features
- Modular structure with clear separation of functionalities
- Handles structured meshes for solving fluid flow problems
- Highly scalable

## Next Steps
- Expand to a 3D solver (partially completed)
- Develop a coupled flow-heat solver (compressible)
- Implement post-processing capabilities (.vtk, .dat)
- Extend to additional algorithms such as SIMPLEC, PIMPLE, and PISO
